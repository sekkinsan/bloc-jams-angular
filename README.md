## Introduction
jjams is a single-page music player application built with Angular that is much like Spotify. It is my first web development project where I had to fail many times in order to learn from it.

## Problem
As this was my first project, there were many instances of wanting to give up, many confused moments especially with how things were working with Angular. I was somewhat familiar with JavaScript by this point, but introducing Angular as my first framework threw me off quite a bit. It was quite difficult for me to grasp the concepts of directives and modules, as well as the introduction to the MVC and MVVM framework. It felt like a lot of information to take in when just a few days ago I was finally getting the hang of loops and if statements in JavaScript.

## Solution
It took a lot of research and becoming accustomed to asking for help, especially in this industry. One of the main things I needed help with was creating the directive that controls song and volume sliders, I couldn't get the jQuery to work properly, but was able to find a solution to this issue with the documentation and some trial and error.

## Results
I was able to complete my first project! Although it isn't quite up to Spotify's level with multiple artists to choose from, it's functional with a set of pre-saved music. The work process was filled with a lot of anxiety and stress, but overall I'm satisfied with the end result of this project. I was able to learn a lot, especially about DOM elements and jQuery, and hope to be able to go deeper into web development to create more and more apps.
